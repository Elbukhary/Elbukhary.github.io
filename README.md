## Welcome to My Portfolio Page

I am Muhammad Bukhari, an active learner and contributor in data science. I have huge passion for data analytics. I make this page as my portfolio for anyone interested to see. 

Currently I am a mechanical laboratory test engineer, yet looking for opportunities at a more demanding field.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Elbukhary/Elbukhary.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Elbukhary/Elbukhary.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
